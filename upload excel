If you want to display the data from an Excel file in a table on a webpage (using ASP.NET), you can create a simple ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core application that reads the Excel file and renders the data in an HTML table.

Here's how you can achieve that:

Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Core MVC Project
Open Visual Studio and create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application project.
Select the MVC template.
Step 2: Install the EPPlus NuGet Package
Install the EPPlus NuGet package as we did earlier:

Install-Package EPPlus
Step 3: Create the Model (if needed)
If you'd like to create a model for the data (optional), you can define a class to represent a row of data in the Excel sheet. But if you only want to read and display data directly, we can skip the model and handle everything in the controller.

Step 4: Create a Controller to Handle the Excel File Upload and Display
Create a controller that will read the Excel file and pass the data to the view.

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using OfficeOpenXml;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

namespace ExcelMvcApp.Controllers
{
    public class ExcelController : Controller
    {
        // GET: Excel
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        // POST: Excel/Upload
        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Upload(IFormFile file)
        {
            if (file != null && file.Length > 0)
            {
                using (var stream = new MemoryStream())
                {
                    file.CopyTo(stream);
                    using (var package = new ExcelPackage(stream))
                    {
                        var worksheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets[0];
                        var rowCount = worksheet.Dimension.Rows;
                        var colCount = worksheet.Dimension.Columns;
                        var data = new List<List<string>>();

                        // Loop through rows and columns to fetch data
                        for (int row = 1; row <= rowCount; row++)
                        {
                            var rowData = new List<string>();
                            for (int col = 1; col <= colCount; col++)
                            {
                                rowData.Add(worksheet.Cells[row, col].Text);
                            }
                            data.Add(rowData);
                        }

                        // Pass data to the view
                        return View("Index", data);
                    }
                }
            }

            return View("Index");
        }
    }
}
Step 5: Create the View to Display the Data
Next, you need to create a view where the data will be displayed in an HTML table. In the Views/Excel/Index.cshtml file, you can render the table as follows:

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Excel Data";
}

<h2>@ViewData["Title"]</h2>

<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" asp-action="Upload">
    <input type="file" name="file" />
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>

@if (Model != null && Model.Count > 0)
{
    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                @for (int i = 0; i < Model[0].Count; i++)
                {
                    <th>Column @i</th>
                }
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var row in Model)
            {
                <tr>
                    @foreach (var cell in row)
                    {
                        <td>@cell</td>
                    }
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}
else
{
    <p>No data available or file not uploaded yet.</p>
}
Step 6: Configure Your Project to Allow File Uploads
Make sure your application can handle file uploads by configuring the necessary settings in Startup.cs (or Program.cs in .NET 6 and beyond):

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllersWithViews();

    // Add support for file uploads
    services.Configure<FormOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.MultipartBodyLengthLimit = 104857600; // Set a limit for file uploads (100 MB for example)
    });
}
Step 7: Run the Application
Build and run the application.
Go to the URL of your controller (e.g., http://localhost:5000/Excel).
Upload an Excel file.
The data from the Excel file will be displayed in a table on the webpage.
How It Works
Upload Form: The view allows users to upload an Excel file using an HTML <input type="file">.
Controller Logic: When the file is uploaded, the controller reads the Excel data using the EPPlus library.
Displaying Data: The data is then passed to the view and displayed in an HTML table.
This approach allows you to upload an Excel file via a webpage and view its content in a table format.

Notes
File Size Limitation: You might want to limit the file size to avoid large uploads that might affect performance.
Security Considerations: Always sanitize and validate the uploaded file, especially when dealing with file uploads, to prevent security vulnerabilities.
